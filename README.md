# hero-classification
**Machine Learning for beginners**

This is the code used for the hero classification of a certain individual. The code uses a scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of certain characteristics seen in comics. The output will either label the individual as a hero or villain. Thus, we will be able to determine a random individual to be either a hero or villain based on the features (gender, mask, cape, human).

**Dependencies**

* numpy
* scipy 
* Scikit-learn

Once you have all the dependencies installed, run the python script through the terminal using:

```
python hero_classification.py
```
